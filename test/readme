UNRESOLVED:  possum simulated activation does not correlate with given input activity 

use ./runMe.sh to reproduce

1. create input activation from mostly motionless subject data
   * masked with 244 ROIs
   * "T2* units," see original/Scripts/createTemplate.bash (not in runMe.sh)
       `((${TE}/(${TE}/${T2static}-log(a)))-${T2static})/1000`


2. truncate real activation to simulation length, write timecourse and motion file
   * calculate based on junking fist 4 volumes of the simulation
   * use subj recording TR against simulation TR to provide an appropriate number of volumes.
   * start timecourse and motion at junkVolumes*simTR+recordTR and increment by recordTR

3. generate pulse
   * parameters set by fiddling with gui


4. run possum
   * no motion
   * MR and RF default files

5. preprocess
   * included pipeline: restPreproc_possum.bash

6. check how well the simulation correlates to the input 
   * Check_ActivationCorrs_11Vol.R
   * checks overall and per ROI
   * requires R, and install.packages(c('oro.nifti','pracma','fmri'))
