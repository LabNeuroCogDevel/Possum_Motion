Possum divides its work up into a set number of jobs. The time required for each job to complete is variable. 

After submitting to PBS, some have not finished either because the job takes an abnormally long time to finish
or the job was not launched until the time quota was nearly meet.
As a result, unfinished possum jobs vary in expected run time greatly.
Jobs cannot be resumed; they must be started from the beginning.

The run time can be estimated in a very rough sense by extrapolating from the possum log file.
Because Possum simulates 3 different tissue types and the run could have failed at any point in the process,
estimate quality is not consistent. 

Regardless, from these estimates, an attempt can be made to optimizing the time needed to complete previous failed jobs
while minimizing super computing time charged to idle processors.

possumLogtime.pl computes estimates
generateParitions.R  uses biggestFillPartition.R to design naively optimized jobs/processor for each possible partition of processors 2 to #jobs-2


see biggestFillParition.R for naive optimization documentation
