to actually run:
   REALLYRUN=1 ./master.sh 

environment.sh --  should contain vars that point to needed files (brain, pulse, rf, mr)

master.sh      --  use variables/activation* and variables/*motion to decided what loops to run
               --  timecourse for activation is expected to have the same prefix as .nii.gz but end with _time

	       --  calls qsub on queuer.sh  ceil(numpoc/16) times
               --  spawns        waiter.sh  to wait for all to finish and run possum_sum & signal2image

               -- UNCOMMET actual qsub command


queuer.sh      -- UNCOMMENT actual run code (currently only echos what it would do)

waiter.sh      -- corrected bad logic in detecing if complete. UNTESTED (grep -l |wc == totalcpus --> end wait loop) 



----- use case server rebooted. not all completed:
o  ./master.sh to see which didn't run (looks in logs for finished text)
o  check run output
o  REALLYRUN=1 QSUBCOMMAND="qsub -h -m abe -M foranw@upmc.edu" ./master.sh
