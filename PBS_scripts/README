master.sh      --  use variables/activation* and variables/*motion to decided what loops to run
               --  timecourse for activation is expected to have the same prefix as .nii.gz but end with _time

queuer.sh      -- UNCOMMENT actual run code (currently only echos what it would do)

waiter.sh      -- corrected bad logic in detecing if complete. UNTESTED (grep -l |wc == totalcpus --> end wait loop)
